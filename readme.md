# DAGger: Sparse Voxel DAG Raycasting on the Web

[Live Demo](http://45.77.96.202/dagger/)

Web version of the viewer application from the [SymVox](https://github.com/RvanderLaan/SymVox) repository.

Goal: Render Sparse Voxel DAG in the browser using WebGL.
Due to limitations of WebGL, some things need to be rewritten.
- No support for SamplerBuffer, replaced with Texture3D
